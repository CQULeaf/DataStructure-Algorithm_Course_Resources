    "# About the data structure `heapq`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `heapq` module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists. The interesting part about this module is that it transforms a regular list into a heap (a binary tree), wherein for a \"min heap\", the smallest element is kept at the root position (index 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heap Property**: In a heap, for any given node `i`, the value of `i` is:\n",
    "    - Less than or equal to the values of its children for a min heap.\n",
    "    - Greater than or equal to the values of its children for a max heap.\n",
    "   Note: `heapq` only provides min heap functionality by default. Max heap behavior can be simulated by inverting order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functions in `heapq`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `heapify(iterable)`: This function transforms the iterable (usually a list) into a valid heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `heappush(heap, ele)`: This function pushes the element `ele` onto the heap while maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `heappop(heap)`: This function pops the smallest element from the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `heappushpop(heap, ele)`: Pushes the element `ele` onto the heap and then pops and returns the smallest element from the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `heapreplace(heap, ele)`: Pops and returns the smallest element from the heap and then pushes the element `ele` onto the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import heapq\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a list\n",
    "    nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Convert the list into a heap\n",
    "    heapq.heapify(nums)\n",
    "    print(nums)  # The list now represents a min heap\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Push elements onto the heap\n",
    "    heapq.heappush(nums, 7)\n",
    "    print(nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Pop the smallest element\n",
    "    print(heapq.heappop(nums))\n",
    "    print(nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Push and pop\n",
    "    print(heapq.heappushpop(nums, 8))\n",
    "    print(nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Replace smallest element\n",
    "    print(heapq.heapreplace(nums, 0))\n",
    "    print(nums)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Points**:\n",
    "    - The underlying structure is a binary tree, but `heapq` represents this using a linear list structure.\n",
    "    - The tree is complete. Every level of the tree is fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "    - The element at index `i` has its children at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` and its parent at index `(i-1)//2`.\n",
    "    - Because of the above properties, a heap can be efficiently implemented as a list, and operations like insertion and extraction of the minimum element can be done in logarithmic time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practical Uses**:\n",
    "    - Priority Queues: Where you want to retrieve elements based on some priority.\n",
    "    - Heapsort: An efficient sorting algorithm.\n",
    "    - Shortest Path algorithms like Dijkstra's.\n",
    "\n",
    "# About the algorithm `Greedy Algorithm`\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A greedy algorithm follows the problem-solving heuristic of making **the locally optimal choice** at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum. In simple terms, it makes the best choice at each step by looking at the current situation, without worrying about the consequences.\n",
    "   - For this problem, the greedy approach is to always sell the stock at a higher price than the purchase price whenever possible. The \"greediness\" here is trying to get an immediate profit without waiting for potentially higher profits in the future. \n",
    "   - Greedy algorithms don't always produce the globally optimal solution, but for many problems, they do. It's important to analyze and ensure that a greedy strategy will yield the correct solution for the given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, the greedy strategy of selling stocks when there's a profit to be made is a sound one, because we are instructed to sell them the next day if there's a profit opportunity. The algorithm does just that, selling the stocks bought at the lowest prices first, which ensures the maximum possible profit for that day."

    "`collections` is a built-in Python module that provides ***alternative container datatypes*** to the built-in containers like `list`, `tuple`, etc. Within `collections`, `deque` (pronounced \"deck\" and stands for \"double-ended queue\") is one of the data structures provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `deque` can be visualized as a list-like container with fast appends and pops from both ends. Here are some key features and benefits of using `deque`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast Operations on Both Ends**: Appending to or popping from either end of a `deque` is an O(1) operation. This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where you need to add/remove elements from both the start and end of a collection frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bounded Length**: You can instantiate a `deque` with a maximum length. Once it reaches its maximum size, when new items are added, a corresponding number of items are discarded from the opposite end.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thread-Safe**: The `deque` operations are atomic, so it's safe to use in multi-threaded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rotate**: One useful method in `deque` is `rotate`, which allows you to shift all elements by `n` steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `rotate` operation in a deque shifts all the elements in the deque by a certain number of steps. Positive values of the step shift elements to the right, and negative values shift elements to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Let's consider a deque `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - `rotate(1)` will shift all elements 1 step to the right. The last element will move to the beginning: `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "      - `rotate(-1)` will shift all elements 1 step to the left. The first element will move to the end: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Another example, if you have `[1, 2, 3]` and you `rotate(2)`, it becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple usage example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "d = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "d.append(6)       # Add to the right end: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "d.appendleft(0)   # Add to the left end:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "d.pop()           # Remove from the right end: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "d.popleft()       # Remove from the left end:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

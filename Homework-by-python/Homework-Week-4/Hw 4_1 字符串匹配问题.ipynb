    "This code is designed to iterate through each character in the string `s`, using the list `stack` to keep track of the brackets. The dictionary `mapping` and the list `order` are used to determine whether the brackets are matching and in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: \n",
    "   - Assume `stack = []` is an empty list initialized before this block of code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **For Loop**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for char in s:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This iterates through each character in the string `s`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **First If Condition**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if char in mapping.values():\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This checks if the current character is an opening bracket ('<', '(', '[', '{').\n",

    "       return \"NO\"\n",

    "   - This checks if the stack is not empty and if the current opening bracket has an index lower than the one at the top of the stack. If this condition is met, it means the brackets are not in the desired order, and \"NO\" is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Append to Stack**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack.append(char)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the conditions are not met, the opening bracket is added to the `stack`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Second If Condition**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   elif char in mapping.keys():\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This checks if the current character is a closing bracket ('>', ')', ']', '}').\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Nested If Condition in Second Block**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():\n",
    "       return \"NO\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the stack is empty, or the top bracket in the stack does not match with the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, \"NO\" is returned.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **Else Condition**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       return \"NO\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current character is not an opening or closing bracket, \"NO\" is returned.\n",
    "   \n",
    "9. **Final Check**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return \"YES\" if not stack else \"NO\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - After all characters are processed, if the `stack` is empty (meaning all brackets were matched), \"YES\" is returned. Otherwise, \"NO\" is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the `stack` is used to keep track of the sequence of opening brackets, and the dictionary `mapping` and list `order` are used to enforce the rules of matching and order."

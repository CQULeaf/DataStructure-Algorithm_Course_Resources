# KEY POINTS ANALYSIS

```python
def GCD(a,b):
    if b==0:
        return a
    else:
        return GCD(b,a%b)
```

## Key Concepts 1

1. **Recursion**: The function calls itself to reduce the problem to smaller parts.
2. **Modulus Operator `%`**: Used to find the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

## Function Operation 1

- `GCD(a, b)` calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- If `b == 0`, it returns `a`.
- Otherwise, it recursively calls `GCD(b, a % b)`.

```python
def LCM(a,b):
    return a*b//GCD(a,b)
```

## Key Concepts 2

1. **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: The smallest multiple that is evenly divisible by both `a` and `b`.
2. **Integer Division `//`**: Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer. (also called **Floor Division**)

## Function Operation 2

- `LCM(a, b)` calculates the Least Common Multiple of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). (refer to contents of number theory)

***

```python
a,b=map(int,input().split())
```

## Key Concepts 3

1. **Tuple Unpacking**: `a, b = ...` assigns values to `a` and `b` simultaneously.
2. **`map()` Function**: Applies the `int` function to each element in the list.
3. **`input().split()`**: Reads a string from user input and splits it into a list.

## Function Operation 3

- This line takes a space-separated string input, splits it into a list, converts each element to an integer, and then assigns them to `a` and `b`.

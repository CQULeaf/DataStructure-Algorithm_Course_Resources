# KEY POINTS ANALYSIS

## We can analyse the code step by step logically

### 1. Function Definition and Parameters

```python
def generate_permutations(arr, n, curr_permutation):
```

Here we define a function called `generate_permutations`. It has three parameters:

- `arr`: The list of numbers we want to generate permutations for.
- `n`: The length of the permutations.
- `curr_permutation`: The current permutation being formed.

### 2. Base Case

```python
if len(curr_permutation) == n:
    print(" ".join(map(str, curr_permutation)))
    return
```

**What it does**: When the length of `curr_permutation` reaches `n`, we print it out and stop the recursion.

### 3. Initialize Seen Set

```python
seen = set()
```

**What it does**: Initializes an empty set called `seen`. This will help us avoid duplicates.

### 4. Main Loop

```python
for i in range(len(arr)):
```

**What it does**: Iterates over each element in the `arr`.

### 5. Check for Duplicates

```python
if arr[i] not in seen:
```

**What it does**: We only consider elements that haven't been added to `seen` yet.

### 6. Backtracking Logic

```python
seen.add(arr[i])
curr_permutation.append(arr[i])
next_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]
generate_permutations(next_arr, n, curr_permutation)
curr_permutation.pop()
```

**What it does**: This is the core logic.

- We add the current element to `seen`.
- We add it to the current permutation (`curr_permutation`).
- We remove it from the array (`next_arr`), making a recursive call to find further permutations.
- We "undo" the last step by popping the last element (this is known as backtracking).

### 7. Input and Initial Function Call

```python
N = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
generate_permutations(arr, N, [])
```

**What it does**: Takes the user input, sorts the array for lexicographical ordering, and then makes the initial function call.

## The function `sort()` details

Arrange the elements in the array based on their individual characters in dictionary order. This is akin to how words are sorted in a dictionary: you look at the first character, then the second, and so on.

In the context of numbers or strings, sorting them lexicographically will rearrange them so that their character representations are in ascending order. For instance:

- A lexicographically sorted array of strings might look like this: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
- For numbers represented as strings, lexicographically sorting would arrange them based on each digit: `["10", "2", "21"]`.

In the given code, the array `arr` is sorted to ensure that the generated permutations are also sorted lexicographically.

```python
# Ensure the array is sorted to produce lexicographically sorted output
arr.sort()
```

By sorting `arr` initially, the recursive function `generate_permutations()` will generate permutations in lexicographical order, because it picks elements in the order they appear in the sorted array.

### The rules we should obey when sorting

When sorting elements lexicographically, the following detailed rules are generally applied:

1. **Character Comparison**: Lexicographic ordering compares the individual characters (e.g., alphabets, digits) in the strings one by one, starting from the first character.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: In most programming languages, uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in the ASCII table. Therefore, "B" will come before "a" in a lexicographic sort unless you specify case-insensitive sorting.

    ```python
    "Ball" comes before "apple"
    ```

3. **Number as String**: If numbers are represented as strings, they are sorted based on the ASCII values of individual digits, not their numerical values. This means "10" will come before "2" if sorted lexicographically.

    ```python
    "10", "2", "21" sorted lexicographically would be "10", "2", "21"
    ```

4. **Shorter Before Longer**: If two strings have identical prefixes, the shorter string comes before the longer one.

    ```python
    "apple" comes before "applejack"
    ```

5. **Non-alphanumeric Characters**: Special characters are also sorted based on their ASCII values. Usually, these will come before alphanumeric characters depending on their ASCII values.

6. **Unicode**: In a system supporting Unicode, the Unicode code points are used for characters outside the ASCII range.

7. **Locale-specific Rules**: Some languages have specific rules for sorting words that might not follow ASCII or Unicode orderings exactly. These need to be specially handled, typically using locale-specific collation rules.

Understanding these rules can help to predict how a lexicographic sort will rearrange an array of strings or numbers represented as strings.

## The data structure `set()` details

The `set()` data structure in Python is used to store unique elements. The set is mutable, meaning we can add or remove items after the set is created. Here's how it works:

### Basic Operations

1. **Initialization**: You can initialize an empty set using `set()` or a set with initial values like `set([1, 2, 3])`.

    ```python
    my_set = set()
    ```

2. **Add Elements**: Use the `add()` method to add an element.

    ```python
    my_set.add(1)  # my_set is now {1}
    ```

3. **Remove Elements**: Use the `remove()` or `discard()` method to remove an element. The `remove()` method will raise an error if the element is not found, while `discard()` will not.

    ```python
    my_set.remove(1)  # my_set is now {}
    ```

4. **Check Existence**: You can use the `in` keyword to check if an element exists in a set.

    ```python
    if 1 in my_set:
        print("Exists")
    ```

5. **Length**: The `len()` function can be used to get the number of items.

    ```python
    len(my_set)
    ```

6. **Iteration**: You can loop through the set using a `for` loop.

    ```python
    for item in my_set:
        print(item)
    ```

### Properties

1. **Unordered**: Sets are unordered, meaning the items are not indexed.

2. **Unique Elements**: Sets don't allow duplicate values.

3. **Immutable Elements**: Elements in a set must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples), but the set itself is mutable.

4. **Mathematical Operations**: You can perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

In the code you've been looking at, a `set` named `seen` is used to keep track of elements that have already been included in a permutation, which helps to avoid duplicates.

## The algorithms used like `backtracking` and `recursion`

### Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries out all possibilities to find an answer. It starts with a possible option, tests it for suitability, and then moves forward if it's a valid solution; otherwise, it reverses and tries the next option. Backtracking is particularly useful when you have a number of choices and you need to find all possible combinations or permutations, like in this code.

- **Where is it in the code?**

  ```python
  curr_permutation.append(arr[i])
  # (recursive call here)
  curr_permutation.pop()
  ```

  Here, the program appends an element, makes a recursive call to proceed with this choice, and then pops the element back out. This popping action is the essence of backtrackingâ€”it's as if you're saying, "This path didn't work, let's try another one."

### Recursion

Recursion is a method where a function calls itself in its definition. It's useful for breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.

- **Where is it in the code?**
  
  ```python
  generate_permutations(next_arr, n, curr_permutation, visited)
  ```

  Here, `generate_permutations` is calling itself. The key point is that each time it does, it uses a slightly different problem (`next_arr`, which has one fewer element) to solve.

- **Base Case**:
  
  ```python
  if len(curr_permutation) == n:
      print(" ".join(map(str, curr_permutation)))
      return
  ```

  Every recursive function needs a base case, a situation where it doesn't call itself again. Here, it's when the length of `curr_permutation` reaches `n`, which means a full permutation is formed.

So in summary, the function uses recursion to explore each possibility (each permutation), and it uses backtracking to undo a choice if it turns out to be unsuitable for reaching the final goal (a complete permutation).

## About the `queue` header file

* `<queue>` is a header file in the C++ Standard Library that provides several queue-based data structures, including the basic `queue` and the `priority_queue`.
* A priority queue is a data structure that keeps its elements in a sorted order according to some criteria (often based on the element values). The element with the highest priority is always at the front. Priority queues are often implemented using a heap data structure.

***The `queue` header file is relative to the code `priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_heap;`***

* In the code, `priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_heap;` creates a min-heap, meaning that the smallest element is always at the top. Here's a breakdown:
    1. The first template argument `int` specifies the type of the elements in the priority queue.
    2. The second template argument `vector<int>` specifies the underlying container to use. In this case, it's a vector.
    3. The third template argument `greater<int>` is a comparison functor that determines the order of the elements. `greater<int>` makes it so that the priority queue behaves like a min-heap (with the smallest element at the top). If we used `less<int>`, it would behave like a max-heap.

In the provided code, the `min_heap` priority queue is used to track the prices of stocks bought. When deciding whether to sell a stock, the code checks the top of the `min_heap` to get the smallest price (i.e., the cheapest stock bought) and sells it if profitable.

## What's the differences between `list` in python and `vector` in C++

Both Python's `list` and C++'s `vector` are dynamic array-like data structures that allow us to store and manage collections of elements. They share several similarities in their basic usage, but there are some significant differences due to the nature of the two languages.

1. **Dynamically Resizable**:***(The same)***
    * Both `list` in Python and `vector` in C++ can grow and shrink dynamically, meaning you don't need to know their size ahead of time.

2. **Data Type**:
    * **Python's `list`**: Can hold elements of different data types in the same list (e.g., a mix of integers, strings, and objects).
    * **C++'s `vector`**: Is a template class, and each instance of a `vector` can only hold elements of a specific type. For example, a `vector<int>` can only hold integers.

3. **Performance & Memory**:
    * **Python's `list`**: Generally consumes more memory per element because of the overhead associated with dynamic typing and object storage.
    * **C++'s `vector`**: Tends to be more memory-efficient for simple types because it's storing them in a contiguous block without extra overhead.

4. **Operations**:***(partially the same)***
    * Many of the basic operations are similar, like appending to the end (`append` in Python, `push_back` in C++), accessing an element by index, and finding the size (`len()` in Python, `size()` in C++).
    * However, C++'s `vector` also provides direct memory-related operations like `reserve()`, which can be used to pre-allocate memory for performance reasons.

5. **Underlying Implementation**:***(partially the same)***
    * Both are backed by arrays, but the internal management, memory allocation, and resizing strategies might differ.

6. **Error Handling**:
    * **Python**: Will raise an exception (like `IndexError`) for out-of-bounds access or other issues.
    * **C++**: Out-of-bounds access on a `vector` without using the `at()` method is undefined behavior, which might lead to crashes or unexpected results. With `at()`, it throws an `out_of_range` exception.

7. **Memory Management**:
    * **Python**: Uses garbage collection to automatically reclaim memory.
    * **C++**: `vector` manages its memory automatically, but C++ in general requires more manual memory management (though `vector` abstracts much of this away).

8. **Safety & Flexibility**:
    * **Python**: Being a high-level language, it abstracts away many complexities and is more forgiving.
    * **C++**: Offers more control at the cost of safety. It allows for direct memory access, pointer manipulation, etc.

In many ways, their usage is similar, especially for basic operations. For someone transitioning from Python to C++, a `vector` will often feel like the closest analog to a Python `list`. However, the static typing of C++ and the finer control it offers over memory and performance mean that there are more things to consider and more potential pitfalls when working with `vector`.

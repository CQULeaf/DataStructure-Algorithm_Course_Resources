## About the header files `<stack>` and `<unordered_map>`

**`<stack>`**:
`stack` is a container adapter in the C++ Standard Library that provides a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first element to be removed.

- **Basic Operations**:
  - `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack. Note: This function does not return the popped element.
  - `top()`: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - `empty()`: Returns true if the stack is empty; otherwise, false.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

For example:

```cpp
std::stack<int> myStack;
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.push(3);

int topElement = myStack.top();  // topElement will be 3
myStack.pop();
```

**`<unordered_map>`**:
`unordered_map` is a container in the C++ Standard Library that provides a way to store key-value pairs in an unordered fashion. It offers constant-time average complexity for most operations and is based on a hash table.

- **Basic Operations**:
  - `insert({key, value})`: Inserts the key-value pair into the map.
  - `at(key)`: Returns the value associated with the given key.
  - `operator[key]`: Returns a reference to the value with the given key. If the key does not exist, it inserts a new key-value pair with a default-initialized value.
  - `erase(key)`: Removes the key-value pair with the given key.
  - `find(key)`: Returns an iterator to the key-value pair if the key is found. Otherwise, it returns an iterator to `unordered_map::end`.

For example:

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;
myMap["apple"] = 5;
myMap["banana"] = 3;

int appleCount = myMap["apple"];  // appleCount will be 5
```

In the provided code:

- The `stack` is being used to maintain the order of the opened brackets, helping in matching them with their corresponding closing brackets.
- The `unordered_map` (`mapping`) is used to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket, which makes it easy to check if the current closing bracket matches the last opened bracket (i.e., the top of the stack).

## What's the similarities and differences between `unordered_map` in C++ and `dicts` in python

*Similarities:*

1. **Key-Value Pairs**: Both structures store data in the form of key-value pairs.

2. **Lookup Time**: They offer average constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

3. **Unordered**: As the name `unordered_map` suggests, and as is the case with Python dictionaries, there's no specific order maintained for the elements.

4. **Unique Keys**: Both structures do not allow duplicate keys. Inserting a value for an existing key will overwrite the old value in both cases.

*Differences:*

1. **Implementation**:
   - **`unordered_map`**: Internally, C++'s `unordered_map` is typically implemented using a hash table.
   - **Python's dict**: While Python dictionaries are also based on a hash table, the exact implementation can be different across Python versions and might have optimizations specific to the language.

2. **Syntax**:
   - **`unordered_map`**: Uses the `[]` operator for both access and insertion. If the key doesn't exist and you use the `[]` operator, it'll create a default-initialized entry for that key.

     ```cpp
     std::unordered_map<std::string, int> umap;
     umap["apple"] = 5;
     int appleCount = umap["apple"];
     ```

   - **Python's dict**: Similar to `unordered_map` but has more built-in methods tailored for dynamic languages.

     ```python
     my_dict = {}
     my_dict["apple"] = 5
     apple_count = my_dict["apple"]
     ```

3. **Type Restrictions**:
   - **`unordered_map`**: Being a C++ template, it's strictly typed. You define the types of both the key and value when you declare the map.
   - **Python's dict**: Being in a dynamically-typed language, it can store any type as its key or value without declaration.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **`unordered_map`**: Accessing a non-existent key using `at()` function throws an `std::out_of_range` exception.
   - **Python's dict**: Accessing a non-existent key raises a `KeyError`.

5. **Methods and Functions**:
   - **`unordered_map`**: Offers methods like `insert()`, `erase()`, and `find()`.
   - **Python's dict**: Offers a rich set of built-in methods like `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, and `pop()`, among others.

6. **Memory and Performance**:
   - While both are optimized for their respective environments, C++'s `unordered_map` might allow for more fine-tuning in terms of performance and memory usage due to the nature of the language. Python's dictionary is designed to be more user-friendly and might have some overhead due to its dynamic nature.

## Dive deeper into `using namespace std;`

The `std::` prefix denotes that a particular name or entity belongs to the C++ Standard Library's namespace named `std`.

1. **Namespaces in C++**: C++ introduced namespaces as a way to avoid naming conflicts. The C++ Standard Library is placed in the `std` namespace. When we use something from the Standard Library, we need to indicate where it's coming from, hence the `std::` prefix.

2. **Using `using namespace`**: We might have seen code that starts with `using namespace std;`. When this directive is used, it essentially tells the compiler, "For this scope, if you see a name you don't recognize, check if it's in the `std` namespace." This allows us to write code without the `std::` prefix.

   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
   ```

3. **Potential Issues with `using namespace std;`**:
   - **Name Conflicts**: If we write your own function or class with a name that's also present in the `std` namespace (like `count`, `find`, etc.), you might inadvertently run into ambiguous naming issues.
   - **Readability**: For someone reading the code, seeing `std::` makes it instantly clear that the entity belongs to the Standard Library. Without the prefix, a reader might have to check for namespace directives or make assumptions.
   - **Maintainability**: Future versions of C++ might add new names to the `std` namespace. If your code uses `using namespace std;` and you also have entities with those names, we'll face conflicts when updating to newer C++ versions.

4. **When is it Okay to Use `using namespace std;`?**: While it's generally discouraged in larger projects or libraries to maintain clarity and avoid conflicts, it's commonly used in small programs, competitive programming, or when learning C++ to make the code concise.

In the end, while we can write C++ code without always prefixing `std::`, it's considered good practice in professional settings to either use the prefix or be very selective about using `using` directives to avoid potential pitfalls. If we omit it without a proper `using` directive, the compiler will throw an error because it won't recognize names like `cout`, `cin`, `vector`, etc.

## Some Q&A about the syntax in this code

### The condition in `for (char charact : s)`

This is a C++11 feature called a **range-based for loop**. It's a more concise way to iterate over each element in a container (like arrays, strings, vectors, etc.) without having to manually deal with iterators or indices.

In this loop:

- `char charact` declares a variable named `charact` of type `char`.
- `: s` means "for each character in the string `s`".
- The loop will iterate once for each character in `s`, and during each iteration, `charact` will hold the current character.

It's equivalent to the traditional loop:

```cpp
for (std::string::iterator it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); ++it) {
    char charact = *it;
    // ... rest of the loop
}
```

### The condition in `order.find(charact) != std::string::npos`

1. **Goal of the code**: The code is trying to check if a specific character (`charact`) is present in the string named `order`.

2. **Breaking down the code**:
   - **`order.find(charact)`**: This will try to find the character `charact` inside the string `order`.
       - If it finds the character, it returns the position (or index) of where the character is found.
       - If it doesn't find the character, it returns a special value, which is `std::string::npos`.

   - **`!= std::string::npos`**: This is checking if the result from the `find` function is **not** the special "not found" value (`std::string::npos`). If it's not this value, it means the character was found in the string.

3. **In simple words**: The entire condition `order.find(charact) != std::string::npos` can be read as:
   "Is the character `charact` found inside the string `order`?"

If the result is `true`, then `charact` is in `order`. If the result is `false`, then `charact` is not in `order`.

#### What's the `std::string::npos`

`std::string::npos` is a special constant value defined by the `std::string` class. Its purpose is to represent positions that are not valid or to indicate that something was not found.

- It is indeed an integer value, not a string. Specifically, it's of type `std::string::size_type`, which is typically an alias for some form of unsigned integer, like `size_t`.

To be a bit more technical:

- `std::string::npos` is the largest possible value for the data type `std::string::size_type`.
- In practice, this value is typically equivalent to `(size_t) -1`. Since `size_t` is an unsigned integer type, this means that `npos` will be a very large number (all bits set to 1).

##### What's is `size_t`

`size_t` is a type defined in the C++ Standard Library that's used for representing sizes and counts. It's an unsigned integral data type, which means it can represent non-negative integers (i.e., it cannot represent negative numbers).

1. **Unsigned**: As mentioned, `size_t` is unsigned, which means it can only represent non-negative values. If we attempt to assign a negative number to a `size_t` variable, we'll end up with a large positive value due to the way unsigned integer arithmetic works.

2. **Platform-Dependent Size**: The actual size (in bytes) of `size_t` can vary based on the architecture and compiler. On many 32-bit platforms, it's 4 bytes (like an `unsigned int`), whereas on 64-bit platforms, it's often 8 bytes (like an `unsigned long long` on many compilers).

3. **Common Uses**:
   - It's the return type for the `size()` function of many container types in the C++ Standard Library, like `std::string`, `std::vector`, etc.
   - It's commonly used in loops to iterate over the elements of containers.
   - Functions that deal with memory allocation, like `malloc` and `sizeof`, also use `size_t`.

4. **Clarification**:
   - The `_t` suffix is a convention in C and C++ for type definitions. It stands for "type." For example, `int32_t` is a type that represents a 32-bit integer, and `ptrdiff_t` is a type representing the difference between two pointers. In the case of `size_t`, it represents a "size type."

5. **Inclusion**: It's defined in many standard library headers, such as `<cstddef>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and others.

For example, when we want to loop over a `std::vector`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
    std::cout << vec[i] << std::endl;
}
```

Here, using `size_t` for the loop index `i` ensures that the type of `i` matches the type of the value returned by `vec.size()`, preventing potential type mismatch issues.

It's good practice to use `size_t` when dealing with sizes and indices in the C++ Standard Library, as it ensures our code works consistently across different platforms and compilers.

***The differences between `size_t` and `int`***

- `int` can represent both positive and negative values. In contrast, `size_t` is designed to represent sizes, which can't be negative. Using `size_t` ensures you don't accidentally use negative indices or sizes.
- The range of `int` is platform-dependent. For example, on some systems, `int` might not be large enough to represent the size of very large containers. `size_t`, however, is designed to represent sizes up to the maximum possible for the platform.
- Using `size_t` communicates intent. When you see a variable of type `size_t`, you know it's meant to represent a size or an index, which makes your code clearer.

### The condition: `mapping.find(charact) != mapping.end()`

**`mapping.find(charact)`**: This tries to find the character `charact` as a key inside the `mapping` unordered map.

- If it finds the key, it returns an iterator pointing to the key-value pair.
- If it doesn't find the key, it returns an iterator that points to `mapping.end()`, which represents a position just past the last element in the unordered map.

**`mapping.end()`**: This represents a position just beyond the last element in the unordered map. It's not an element itself, but a marker to show that you've reached the end.

The condition `else if (mapping.find(charact) != mapping.end())` is checking whether the character `charact` exists as a key in the `mapping` unordered map.

- If `charact` is found in `mapping`, `mapping.find(charact)` will return an iterator pointing to the key-value pair, which will be different from `mapping.end()`.
- If `charact` is not found, `mapping.find(charact)` will return `mapping.end()`.

So, in simple terms, the condition can be read as:
"Is the character `charact` a key in the `mapping` unordered map?"

If the condition is `true`, it means `charact` exists as a key in `mapping`. If `false`, it means `charact` does not exist in `mapping`.

### The condition: `const auto &res : results`

#### 1. Range-based `for` loop

This loop offers a concise way to iterate over all elements in a container or a range. Instead of manually iterating with indices or iterators, we directly get access to each element.

#### 2. `const auto &res`

- **`const`**: It means that the variable `res` cannot be used to modify the elements of `results`.

- **`auto`**: This is a keyword that tells the compiler to automatically deduce the type of the variable from its initializer (or from the context, in the case of range-based for loops). Essentially, we're letting the compiler figure out the type of the variable for us.

- **`&`**: It means that `res` is a reference. Instead of creating a copy of each element of `results` during each iteration, `res` will be a reference to the actual element in `results`. This can be more efficient, especially when iterating over a container of large objects, because it avoids unnecessary copies.

- **`res`**: This is the name of the variable we'll use inside the loop to access the current element of `results`.

#### 3. `: results`

This specifies what we're iterating over. In this case, we're iterating over each element in the `results` container.

#### Putting it all together

The entire construct:

```cpp
for (const auto &res : results)
```

can be read as: "For each element (`res`) in `results`, give me a constant reference to it."

As an analogy, if `results` was a book, this loop would be like saying, "For each page (`res`) in this book (`results`), let me look at it without altering anything on the page."

Lastly, inside the loop, we can use `res` to access and work with each individual element of `results`. But, due to the `const` keyword, we can't modify them.

### Delve deeper into the two main roles of the `&` symbol in C++

#### 1. `&` as the Address-of Operator (in Expressions)

When `&` is used in an expression context, it fetches the memory address of its operand.

- **Purpose**: To retrieve the memory address of a variable.
  
- **Usage with `*`**: Along with the address-of operator (`&`), C++ provides the dereference operator (`*`). When we have a pointer holding an address, you can use `*` to access (or "dereference") the value stored at that address.
  
- **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int x = 10;
  int* pointer_to_x = &x; // pointer_to_x now holds the address of x

  std::cout << pointer_to_x; // This will print the address of x
  std::cout << *pointer_to_x; // This will print the value of x, i.e., 10
  ```

  In this scenario, `&x` fetches the address of `x`, and `*pointer_to_x` dereferences that address to get the value stored at that address.

#### 2. `&` as a Reference Type (in Type Declarations)

When `&` is used in a type declaration, it declares a reference type, which is essentially an alias for another variable. It doesn't hold an address like a pointer; instead, it directly represents another variable.

- **Purpose**: To create an alias that directly refers to an existing variable. It provides an alternative name to access the same variable.
  
- **No Dereferencing Required**: Unlike pointers, we don't need to dereference references to access the referred value. We use a reference just like a regular variable.

- **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int y = 20;
  int& reference_to_y = y; // reference_to_y is now an alias for y
  
  reference_to_y = 30; // This will change the value of y to 30
  
  std::cout << y; // This will print 30
  ```

  Here, `reference_to_y` isn't a new variable that holds a memory address. It's an alias for `y`, so when we change `reference_to_y`, we're directly changing `y`.

**In Summary**:

- In expressions, `&` gets the address of a variable, giving we a pointer. Used alongside `*`, we can fetch or modify the value stored at that address.
  
- In type declarations, `&` creates a reference (alias) to an existing variable. This reference directly accesses or modifies the original variable without needing dereferencing.

## Talk about `file operations`

File operations are quite common in C++, and they're particularly useful when we want to read data from a file or write data to a file. The `<fstream>` library provides all the necessary functionalities to deal with files. Here are some key concepts related to file operations:

### ifstream: Input File Stream

`ifstream` is used to read data from files. We can think of it as an input stream for files.

#### Syntax for Opening a File (1)

```cpp
ifstream infile("file_name");
```

#### Reading from File

We can read from an `ifstream` object just like we read from `cin` (standard input).

```cpp
int x;
infile >> x;
```

#### Closing a File (1)

It's a good practice to close the file after we're done reading.

```cpp
infile.close();
```

### ofstream: Output File Stream

`ofstream` is used to write data to files. We can think of it as an output stream but for files.

#### Syntax for Opening a File (2)

```cpp
ofstream outfile("file_name");
```

#### Writing to File

We can write to an `ofstream` object just like we write to `cout` (standard output).

```cpp
outfile << "Hello, world!" << endl;
```

#### Closing a File (2)

Closing the file after writing ensures that all data is flushed to the file.

```cpp
outfile.close();
```

### Example in the Current Context

In your program, we can see file operations being used like this:

#### Reading from `ball.in`

```cpp
ifstream infile("ball.in");
int N;
infile >> N;
// ... (reading more data)
infile.close();
```

#### Writing to `ball.out`

```cpp
ofstream outfile("ball.out");
outfile << redA << " " << greenA << endl;
outfile << redB << " " << greenB << endl;
outfile.close();
```

These operations help us read the number of balls and their properties from `ball.in` and write the sorted output to `ball.out`.

## Talk about the `custom sort algorithm`

```cpp
    sort(balls.begin(), balls.end(), [](const Ball& a, const Ball& b)
        {return (a.number > b.number) || (a.number == b.number && a.color < b.color);});
```

### Syntax

```cpp
sort(balls.begin(), balls.end(), [](const Ball& a, const Ball& b) {
    return (a.number > b.number) || (a.number == b.number && a.color < b.color);
});
```

1. `sort()`: This is the sorting function provided by the C++ Standard Library, specifically from the `<algorithm>` header.

2. `balls.begin(), balls.end()`: These are iterators pointing to the beginning and the end of the `balls` vector. They define the range of elements to be sorted.

3. `[](const Ball& a, const Ball& b)`: This is a lambda function. It is an anonymous function that defines custom comparison logic. The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are references to `Ball` structs.

4. `return (a.number > b.number) || (a.number == b.number && a.color < b.color);`: This is the body of the lambda function, which specifies the sorting criteria.

### Logic

1. The `sort` function will sort the `balls` vector.
  
2. The lambda function provides the custom rules for sorting, defined as follows:
   - `a.number > b.number`: Prioritize sorting by the `number` field in descending order. Larger numbers come before smaller numbers.
   - `a.number == b.number && a.color < b.color`: If two balls have the same `number`, then prioritize the ball with the smaller `color` value, which means red (0) comes before green (1).

3. The logical OR (`||`) in the return statement means that the first condition is checked first. If it's true, the second condition is not checked. If it's false, the second condition is checked.

In summary, this snippet sorts the `balls` vector in such a way that balls with higher numbers come first, and when numbers are equal, red balls come before green balls.
